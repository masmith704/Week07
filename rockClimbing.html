    <h3>What is Rock Climbing?</h3>

    <p>Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls.
    The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a 
    physically and mentally demanding sport, which often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with
    mental control. It can be a dangerous sport and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialized climbing 
    equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world,
    rock climbing has been separated into several different styles such as Sport lead and Bouldering.</p>
